This repository contains Zimbra plugins for adding MapQuest functionality
to Zimbra webmail.

Plugins:
   - com_mapquest_maps:
        Adds a content handler that scans email messages for addresses and
        activates them so that on mouse-over a map preview tooltip is displayed
        and on click an interactive map dialog is popped up.  Links from the
        interactive map allow easy access to the main mapquest.com site to
        see a larger map or get directions.  This plugin currently only supports
        US based addresses.  In order to support more locales, additional scanning
        logic must be implemented.

   - com_mapquest_links: (pending)
        Adds a portlet allowing quick entry of address and business search terms.
        Upon submitting, short links are generated and preview options are
        available.

Latest built versions are stored in the packages directory for easy access.  These
zip files can be uploaded directly to the Zimbra admin tool for enabling new
zimlets.
